# LeetCode Solutions
This is a repository where I keep my Leetcode solutions! After I solve a problem on LeetCode (possibly also other websites with coding challenges such as Hackerrank or Codewars in the future), I'll record the solutions here so that in the future all of my solutions and approaches are documented in one location. 


## Solution Format 
Although the format may vary from problem to problem, in general, I will list all of the approaches I've used to solve the problem. Typically I only include the solutions that intuitively make sense, unless a significantly better approach in terms of space and time complexity is possible. I will provide an explanation for each problem, as well as its associated space and time complexity. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
im thinking of implementing some kind of tag system, where each problem will have its own directory, and in the readme i could include tags like linked list, hashmap, or two pointers for two sum, and if i really want to see categories at some point i could have some scripts that parses through the readmes and sorts them by cateogry
